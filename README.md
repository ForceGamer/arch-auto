# Automatic Arch Install
Contains comprehensive installation scripts for Archlinux

Including regular BIOS and UEFI installs separately, and a swift install for Virtualbox, including Guest additions and even less user intervention.

Additionally contains a post-install script with my personally favorite software

(The mbr-install.sh is intended for BIOS systems (non-EFI) using GPT, not actually MBR, just too much hassle to change the name)
