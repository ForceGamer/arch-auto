# Automatic Arch Install
Contains comprehensive installation scripts for Archlinux

Including regular BIOS and UEFI installs separately, and a swift install for Virtualbox, including Guest additions and even less user intervention.

Additionally contains a post-install script with my personally favorite software

## arch-install.sh
An installer for Arch intended for UEFI systems. Installs Zen kernel.
## bios-install.sh
An installer for Arch intended for BIOS systems (using GPT). Also installs Zen.
## vbox-speed.sh
An installer intended for Virtualbox. Requires much less user intervention and also installs the Guest Additions.
